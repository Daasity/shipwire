# Shipwire

Ruby gem to integrate with Shipwire's API.

## Installation

Install locally with

```
gem install shipwire
```

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'shipwire'
```

> Note: The master branch is not guaranteed to be in a fully functioning state. It is unwise to use this branch in a production environment.

Run the bundle command:

```
bundle install
```

If you are using Rails, run the generator:

```
rails g shipwire:install
```

## Configuration

Basic configuration

```
Shipwire.configure do |config|
  config.username = "<%= ENV['SHIPWIRE_USERNAME'] %>"
  config.password = "<%= ENV['SHIPWIRE_PASSWORD'] %>"
end
```

`username` - (required) Shipwire username (email address) used for basic auth login to Shipwire

`password` - (required) Shipwire password used for basic auth login to Shipwire.

`open_timeout` - Read timeout in seconds. Default is `2`.

`timeout` - Open/read timeout in seconds. Default is `5`.

`endpoint` - Endpoint base URL to use for requests. Default is `https://api.shipwire.com`.

`logger` - Log requests to STDOUT. Default is `false`.

> Note: There is a difference between an account registered from [https://www.shipwire.com/](https://www.shipwire.com/) and one registered from [https://beta.shipwire.com/](https://beta.shipwire.com/). If you create an account from [https://www.shipwire.com/](https://www.shipwire.com/) and then request data from the beta URL, the API will throw errors about an invalid account. Accounts are only valid from that registration point.

## Testing

Tests are using a throwaway Shipwire Beta account that is only meant for testing. A personal Shipwire Beta account of your own is not required.

Tests require a product named `TEST-PRODUCT` and `TEST-PRODUCT2` to function properly.

```
bundle exec rake spec
```

or

```
bundle exec rspec spec
```
